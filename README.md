# Best_Buy_Last_Price_Change

I have been spending a lot of time window shopping on best buy lately, and a big problem for me is that
I almost always only buy things when they are on sale. Yet some items almost never go on sale, and best buy does
not show this information. Luckily, best buy's API has this information for me to check it with.
